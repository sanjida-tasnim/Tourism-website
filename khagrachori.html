         <h2>KHAGRACHORI</h2>
       </div>
       <p>Khagrachhari , also known as Chengmi ,is a district in Chittagong Division, south-eastern Bangladesh and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Khagrachhari is also known as the Mong Circle (of the rest of the three hill districts Rangamati is the Chakma Circle and Bandarban is the Bohmong Circle). Khagrachhari town is the hometown of the Mong Chief (currently King, or Raja, Saching Prue Chowdhury.</p>

  <h3>HISTORY</h3>
</div>
<p>The Chittagong Hill Tracts was under the reign of the Tripura State, the Arakans and the Sultans in different times before it came under the control of the British East India Company in 1760. Although the British got the authority of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in 1760, they had no authority besides collecting nominal taxes. Until 1860, two kings or chiefs governed the internal administration of this region. In 1860, another circle was formed in present Khagrachhari zila, inhabited by the Tripura population. The chief or the Raja of this circle was selected from the minority Marma population. The circle was named after the Tripura dialect the Mun Circle, but later, the 'Mun dialect', was changed and renamed as Mong Circle. In 1900 the British offered independent status to Chittagong Hill Tracts recognizing the culture and language of the hill tracts population.</p>
