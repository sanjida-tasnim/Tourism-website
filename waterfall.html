    <h5> Bilaichori waterfall</h5>
</div>
</div>
 <p>Billaichori Jhorna is located in the village of Orachari in Farua Union of the district's Bilaiichari district of Rangamati district. Many people call it dhupani Jhorna. Before it was behind the eyes, in 2000 a Buddhist meditator monk started meditating under the Deep Fountain in deep forests.

 At first, he meditated around 03 months and night at this place. After knowing the local people, if the Buddhist meditator monks were to serve the time or occasion of the day, then this fountain became known to the public.

The word tanchangya is called as dhup white and water is called water, ie white water fountain. Basically the water of this fountain is transparent and when its water flows from a very high it is only seen to be clean.

That is why it is called a water vapor. Its height is about 150 meters in height, wild animals, wild pigs, cougar, snakes roam wild animals. Even occasionally there are tigers and bears in the eye. The sound of this spring water is heard from the distance of about 2 kilometers. And in the rainy season it is proved more favorable.

Dhuppani fountain can not be left on Sunday. A saint on this fountain meditates in his ashram. In this local language the priest is called 'Bhante', who does not like any shouting and screaming in these six days. He meditated six days a week and came down to eat just on Sunday. So on Sunday only people were allowed to go to Jhorna.

    <h6> Jaflong waterfall</h6>
</div>
</div>
 
<p>.Jaflong located in the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh, this is a very attractive hilly area. Jaflong is the landmark of limits between two countries. You can go there driving only 60 km northeast of the Sylhet district. Local tourist frequently visits this natural beauty beside river Mari to get a glimpse of rolling stones from hills greenish with the forests. Rising from the great Himalayas, river Mari carries along loads of rocks with the flow.
Tourists go for a boat ride on the river and appreciate the stone collection. Resting at the foothill of Khashia Hill, Jaflong Sylhet is home to native Khasi tribe. Besides the geographic location, the tea garden and the Khasi palli (village) increases the tourism value of this attractive natural beauty. You can relish the lifestyle of Khasi tribe existing in Sylhet, Jaflong for thousands of years. Khasi people has a very exceptional tradition of following a matrilineal system of ancestry and heirloom. For me, this tourist spot filled with mountains and rainfalls is the perfect gateway for long weekends.</p>
